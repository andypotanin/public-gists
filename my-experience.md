I'm a business man who knows how to code. In general, very highly experienced with nearly all aspects of contemporary web development, deployment, DevOps and aspects of building a solid stack that can scale.  Very early adopter of Docker and Node.js., very strong background in WordPress API.

Started programming while in the military when was asked to create a program for tracking detainees. After the military worked as a defense contractor and built an ERP from scratch during a two year project. After defense contracting founded Usability Dynamics, Inc. where was afforded the opportunity to gain a very in-depth familiarity with Docker, CoreOS and DevOps.  

Spent a lot of time improving business workflow and DevOps so our company could continue turning out great work for our clients. 

Also, I had the priviledge of releasing, or helping release, several popular business WordPress plugins such as WP-Stateless, WP-Invoice, WP-CRM and WP-Property.

---

### What's the most amazing application you've built?
Not an application but a Docker-based hosting platform for WordPress applications that focuses on workflow. Used by Usability Dynamics and clients in production. As far as applications, WP-Stateless WordPress plugin is one of my favorites because it helped make WordPress into a proper horizontally-scalable application.

### What types of projects would you love to work on?
Those that require a high-level and a low-level approach. I have the ability to look at the situation from a business perspective on a very high-level but also roll up my sleeves and dig into the technical detail.

### Primary Technology Skills
These are the platforms, technologies and things I've spent a significant amount of time on.

* AWS - CloudFront, Route53, EC2, S3, Cloud9, ELB, CloudFormation
* GCE - Google Cloud Platform/Container Engine, Pub/Sub, Cloud Function, CloudSQL, Storage, VPC Networking, Metadata
* Azure - VM, Virtual Network, Load Balancxer, Storage, Queue Storage and Active Directory
* Heroku - Often used for "off-platform" workers and health monitors.
* Linux OS - Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Debian Wheezy, Debian Jessie and CoreOS Container Linu
* Linux Containers - Docker Image design, testing and and distribution to Docker Hub, Quay and in certain cases private storage. Docker container provisioning, and container lifecyle management and runtime management.
* RKT - Image creation, Stage1 runtimes, Daemon management 
* DockerD, ContainerD, Fleet and SwarmD - Lots of experience with running vertically isolated by horizontally clustered container daemons for unique orchestration requirements. 
* HAproxy - Sveral very advanced and high-traffic HAProxy deployments, typically used for SSL termination and proxying HTTP and TCP services. 
* Varnish - Multiple production Varnish deployments with finely-tuned VLC configurations to meet project requirements. 
* Nginx - Utilized across hundreds of our containers, all sharing a similar configuration, which allows for application-specific extensions and overrides.
* HHVM - Typically used for WP-CLI PHP commands while PHP-FPM with PHP7 is used for web requests to reduce third-party codebase conmpatibility issues.
* Apache2 - Used for certain legacy applications that we host that refuse to give up their .htaccess file.
* PageSpeed - Used in a number of projects, although generally being replaced by customized Node.js middleware, running behind a caching proxy.
* Node.js - Very early adopters of Node.js, dating back to early 2010, before Heroku even supported it. Lots of experience here having created dozens of NPM modules that are public and hundreds of private ones. Some modules we use religiously are PM2, Kue, Redbird, and of course Connect/Express. We have a lot of experience creating complex and bulletproof Express middleware.
* RabbitMQ - Used very often for larger applications that need to distribute work, or simply separate application state and service bus away from the processes. Without RabbitMQ clustering Node.js applications would be much more challenging.
* Client-Facing JavaScript - Knockout.js, RequireJS, AngularJS, Lodash, Backbone, jQuery and jQuery Plugins 
* Third-Party APIs - Stripe, Authorize.net, GitHub, Google Maps, Google Sheets API, Google Compute Engine API, Docker API, Mandrill, WordPress, Packagist/Composer, WHM, Slack
* Git - Wrote Extensions, used advanced subtree methodologies, often leverage config to store state of application
* WordPress - Plugin Development, WordPress API, Horizontal Scaling, cron distribution, etc.
* Elasticsearch - Everything from orchestraiton to designing schemas and mappings to using as my choice data store.
* MySQL, MariaDB and Percona Cluster - Spent a lot of time trying to make MySQL scale along with our Dockerized WordPress sites.

### Portfolio Highlights / Interesting Projects

* Rabbit.ci Container Platform. Robust PaaS for Node.js and WordPress application deployment focused on the GitHub workflow. Platform was created to be a hosting solution that puts the workflow first, making it one of the first hosting platforms that handles the entire CI process. The platform is a self-healing network of CoreOS machines that are moving production containers around the data center with zero-downtime due to a status-aware stte-if-the-art Proxy, powered by a tightly coupled HAProxy + Varnish + Node.js proxy layer. Containers are provisioned automatically when new GitHub branches are created and retired when a branch is removed. Developers can SSH or SFTP into any running environment using their GitHub credentials. The stack provisions CloudFront distributions for each application and handles invalidation requests automatically. Meanwhile the data layer is handled by client-specific Percona Clustetrs with Memcached-based object-caching.
* WP-Stateless - WordPress plugin that helps make WordPress sites operate more like proper "Twelve-Factor" applications by moving Media assets to Google Cloud Storage bucket, used as a "backing service", allowing for WordPress sites to be migrated and scaled horizontally without having to migrate media files. The integration is entirely seamless with WordPress being unaware that the actual files are stored on a remote bucket.
* BoxMLS - A San Francisco based company that is changing the real estate scene. BoxMLS runs a highly distributed network of Node.js microservies with rock-solid continous integration process. Millions of records are stored in an optimized Elasticsearch cluster with tasks and jobs being distributed via RabbitMQ. BoxMLS service monitors multiple MLSs for data changes, normalizes and standardizes real estate data, and can sends change notifications to subscribers even faster than MLS server. 
* Disco Donnie Presents Network - A network of electronic dance music festival websites and mobile applications. Powered by a single WordPress Multisite running across geographically distributed Docker containers. For top-shelf user experience, business data is mirrored in an Elasticsearch cluster that acts as a middleware between the WordPress API and the mobile applications, which use the WordPress API as the mobile-data backend. 
* Red Door Company - A cutting-edge brokerage based out of Durham, NC has a native-feeling React frontned powered by WordPress API. The application platform runs in a distributed Docker cluster, backed by a Percona Cluster for the data layer, augmented by Elasticsearch. The application consumes MLS changes in real-time, analyzing each listing's data and constantly generating unique landing pages to deliver market updates to the web faster than any competitor. 
* Git Docker - A CLI utility that allows developers to easily provision a Docker container for any locally cloned Git directory simply by running "git run" from the directory root. The utility abstracts the Docker run arguments automatically to start a container immediatly with the Git directory being volume-mounted to the container, allowing the developer to continue doing their work with all the necessary services running inside of their container. Developers could override default container settings by modifying simplified options in the git config file. Although this method was very useful and reliable, we later depreciated it in lieu of our more robust GitHub-driven Rabbit.ci Container Platform.
* UDX Product Updates API - A hosted Node.js service that builds WordPress plugins and themes on each GitHub commit for specified branches, assuming tests have passed. Allows users of distributed WordPress products to enable pre-release updates that are handled by the native WordPress Update functionality. The API emulates the WordPress.org responses letting WordPress treat each GitHub conmmit as an updated version of the distributed product.
* Blackbox - One of our first experiments with Docker that actually ran Docker inside Docker to compartmentalize client environments that could then be migrated and re-deployed as a single package, with Docker containers being packaged inside the main Docker Image.
